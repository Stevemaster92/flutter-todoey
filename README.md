# Todoey âœ“

This project is based on the [completed project](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/todoey-flutter) from the Udemy
course *The Complete 2020 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart* taught by Angela Yu. Check out the full course at [www.appbrewery.co](https://www.appbrewery.co/).

## What you can do

This app provides a simple TODO list allowing users to keep track of their tasks.
The objective is to understand different ways on how to manage the app state in Flutter.
Finally, the app makes use of the officially recommended Provider package.
